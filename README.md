# elkjs-cli
This is a simple command line interface to explore the layout algorithms provided by [elkjs](https://github.com/OpenKieler/elkjs) (via [elk](https://github.com/eclipse/elk/))

## Usage
Given a file containing a graph description in json, `myGraph.json`, the layout can be computed with:

```
node index.js myGraph.json
```

This will result in the new graph json being written out to the console.
